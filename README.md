microbit code for school 

## Do note!
I used print() instead of display.scroll() - Much more easier to read. Microbit does need to be plugged into computer to work though- as it sends output through serial onto your computer.

## File locations
pseudocode.md-pseudocode for the main code

main.py-readable code format, with print statements

shortened.py- shortened code format- use if running into memory error

extra.py-updated python file
