microbit code for school 

## Do note!
I used print() instead of display.scroll() - Much more easier to read. Microbit does need to be plugged into computer to work though- as it sends output through serial onto your computer.

multiplayer connect with radio might not work, its kinda buggy for some reason
## File locations
pseudocode.md-pseudocode for the main code

main.py-readable code format, with print statements

shortened.py- shortened code format- hopefully fixes memory error
